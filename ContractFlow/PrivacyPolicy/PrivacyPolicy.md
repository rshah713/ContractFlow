# ContractFlow Privacy Policy

_Effective August 11, 2022_

## What is the Privacy Policy and what does it cover?

The ContactFlow developer team wants you to understand the information we collect and how we use it. That's why we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy. 
In the Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect, use, retain, and transfer information. We help you understand your rights. Each section of the following policy has been written in simpler language to make our practices easier to understand.

## Where is my information stored?
Throughout this policy you will see references to information being "stored", "retained", or "collected." These terms reference your information being stored in a backend database named [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), a service provided by Google. For more information, review [Google Firebase's Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy) on how your data is protected.


## What kinds of information do we collect?

- **Information you provide:** We collect the content you provide us when you use our app. This includes when you sign up for an account, create locations, or create meetings. This can include information about the content you create (henceforth refered to as "metadata"). This metadata can be addresses or wage tied to meetings. This is only used to provide you with that same information if you switch devices or change screens within the app. Our systems automatically process all content to ensure no illegally-formatted data is passed into our backend. 


- **Network and connections:** Information such as your mobile operator or ISP, language is not collected but is used to maintain a connection to our servers and provide you with content in your region's language. The only information we do store is the local timezone in order to provide features such as an automatically loaded Dashboard or center the Add Meeting calendar on the correct date. For internal analytics, the local timezone is also used when an app server error occurs or you request account/data deletion.

## How is this information shared?
ContractFlow is a 100% independent app, soley funded by the developer team. We do not rely on any outside advertising or services and therefore do not share any information from our servers about you or any other app users.

## How can I manage or delete information about me?
Any information you see inside the app is all the information we have in our servers. Aside from internal logs that hold codebase errors, all content in our database is displayed in some part of the ContractFlow app. 

Want to delete your data? Open ContractFlow --> Menu --> Settings --> Delete My Data. Your account is automatically deleted from our servers and your data is marked for deletion. This does not stop you from creating a new account with the same credentials. 

## Legal Compliance
_Note: The following section is not written by a licensed lawyer. This section is written by the app developer in compliance with various government policies._
